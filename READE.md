# .NET Projects

The collection of .NET framework and .NET Core project created using Microsoft Visual Studio 2019-2022 based on .NET Long Term Support (LTS) releases.

__Target:__
- .NET Core - V3.1 (2019) LTS, and some of V5 (the unified platform that combines both .NET Framework and .NET Core, but not LTS), will be more focusing on V6 LTS for the incoming standard.
- .NET Framework - V4.7-4.8 (2019-2021) LTS, Microsoft has announced that there will be no new versions of .NET Framework beyond version 4.8, as the focus has shifted to .NET Core and the unified .NET 5 platform.

_The aim for .NET projects will be **.NET 5 Core** soon_

platform version 6.0 and some projects still using version 4.7-4.8 (which Microsoft no longer support update, but still not the end of life-cycle because of using 
the secure SHA-2 signed certificates), but I still keep maintain for backward compitible.  

_Notes_
_.NET Framework 4.6 and lower version using SHA-1 that the algorithm is no longer secure. I still keep maintain for backward compitible with V4.7-4.8 (which Microsoft no longer support update, but still not the end of life-cycle because of using 
the secure SHA-2 signed certificates)._
